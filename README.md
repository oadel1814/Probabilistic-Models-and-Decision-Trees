# Probabilistic-Models-and-Decision-Trees
This repo focuses on probabilistic and tree-based models for classification. We implemented generative probabilistic classifiers and decision-tree-based models from scratch, evaluated them on real datasets, and compared their performance and modelling assumptions.
